## Project Overview

The **Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Prediction** project aims to create a deep learning model using a neural network to predict the likelihood of successful funding for non-profit organizations by Alphabet Soup Charity. The dataset contains various features related to each organization's application, and by training the model on historical data, the goal is to create a predictive model that can help identify which organizations are more likely to succeed and allocate resources accordingly.

This project involves data preprocessing, neural network model creation, optimization, and evaluation to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is provided as a CSV file named `charity_data.csv`. It contains information about each non-profit organization's application, including various attributes and the target variable `IS_SUCCESSFUL` indicating whether the funding was successful or not.

## Project Requirements

To run this project, you need the following software/tools:

- Python (3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

The required libraries can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn


Instructions to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Run AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb to train the initial model.
Run AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb to explore and optimize the model.
The trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.
Results
The initial model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.45%, which did not meet the target predictive accuracy of 75%. Several optimization attempts were made, including adjustments to the model architecture, activation functions, and regularization techniques. However, the target accuracy was not achieved.

Future Scope
For future improvements, consider the following approaches:

Feature Engineering: Extract more meaningful information from existing features or consider using external datasets to augment the training data.
Model Architectures: Explore other neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-related features or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Continue fine-tuning the model with different activation functions, regularization techniques, and learning rates.
Ensemble Learning: Experiment with ensemble learning techniques to combine multiple models and boost overall accuracy.
